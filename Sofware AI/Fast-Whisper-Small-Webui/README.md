### 2. Set Up a Python Virtual Environment


[Python 3.10.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/)


Create a virtual environment using python 3.10 to avoid dependency conflicts

```bash
py -3.10 -m venv venv

```


### 3. Activate the virtual environment.

```bash

venv\scripts\activate

```


### GPU:
```bash

 pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

```

### CPU:
```bash

 pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

```

### 4. Install the Project and Dependencies

Users with 10 series NVidia cards or AMD GPUs need to manually install the proper torch 2.6.0 versions.
Otherwise just install from requirements.txt

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

With your virtual environment still active, run the script:

```bash
python app.py
```
